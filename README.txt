Project1

Only one python program is included with this project, it can do all three tasks
it can be run by python with no additional arguments but it also features command line functions, for ease of use:
py Project1.py [filename.wav] [operation] argument for operation
operation keywords include "delay" "echo" and "reverb"
when running delay with an argument it increases the seconds of delay
when running echo or reverb, argument changes number of copies of original that are used in the output.wav
